  The Seed DSL Library
</p>

<br/>

## Overview

term.tree contains the DSL definitions for the Seed language's parsing
and compilation system. It provides the declarative grammars that drive
how `.tree` source is parsed, analyzed, and transformed.

### DSL Roles

Each directory under `code/` defines a DSL vocabulary (role).

| role | note |
| --- |:--- |
| `code` | Main programming language terms (task, form, call, fork, walk, etc.) |
| `form` | Simple struct definitions without methods or tasks |
| `bind` | Native binding declarations for code generation (form with `name`, task signatures, seed constants) |
| `mill` | Parser grammar definitions (mine, mint, mill) |
| `seed` | Configuration and settings (key-value constants) |
| `view` | UI component definitions |
| `tune` | Audio processing definitions |
| `flow` | Animation and transition definitions |
| `host` | Server route definitions (extends code with route hooks and port bindings) |
| `line` | CLI command definitions (extends code with argument handling) |
| `base` | Database definitions (migrations with move next/back, queries with find) |
| `book` | Text content markup that generates to HTML, Markdown, or LaTeX |
| `deck` | Package manifest definitions (name, version, dependencies, etc.) |
| `lock` | Lockfile definitions (resolved dependency graph) |
| `text` | Internationalization string definitions (text term, string pairs) |
| `tool` | CLI tool definitions (take, seed, show, send, hook, mill) |
